Welcome to the 33rd issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

_Foliage rendering in Dims_

Dims is an open world creation platform.

In their latest [dev log](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgkhsY8aZO8) they
demonstrate a new foliage rendering and spawning system, which automatically
spawns foliage and trees based on "habitat rules". This means a user
can simply "paint" a world and it will get populated with plants and rocks
automatically.

They are also planing to host a screenshot competition in the next few weeks
for anyone who would like to try out the platform and create their own
landscapes. Sign up for the newsletter on their website to get notified when
it starts!
